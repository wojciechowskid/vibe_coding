    Middleware responsible for closing database connections after each HTTP request.
    It dynamically resolves the DB cleanup function via the `DB_CONNECTIONS_CLOSER_PATH` environment variable.

    Important: This middleware is implemented as a pure ASGI middleware rather than using
    `starlette.middleware.base.BaseHTTPMiddleware`, because BaseHTTPMiddleware wraps `call_next`
    in a new asyncio.Task, which breaks context-dependent connection scoping (e.g., when using
    asyncio.current_task() as a scope key for scoped registries).
